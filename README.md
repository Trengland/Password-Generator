#Password Generator Starter Code
My GitHub repo: https://github.com/Trengland/Password-Generator 

Deployed (live) site:

Steps taken:
// set a variable of the inputs id (password)

// added all symbols and numbers and alphabet characters that could be used

// created a for loop to generate a random password

// associated the password with the input box

// trying to activate the GENERATE button - coder error: a random password is created each time the page is refreshed, but not when pushing the button...

// created on onclick label (gb_Run) in the html file within the button tag - in order to call this out in a function command within script.js - this did not solve my button issue

// tried a second function that was more general for copyPassword to activate the GENERATE button - this did not work either..

// rewatched videos for JavaScript Day 2 and 3

// looked up more JavaScript info and found a better way to create the arrays

// created functions to gather info forom users for what type of PW they want tp generate

// created conditional statement to make sure the system returns one of every character

// created conditional statements to ensure teh user shooses proper char amounts based on limits

// booleans included for same purposes above

// setup the random selection for each users input

// setup the 'generate pw' function - but it's not working - going back over code to find any errors, and including more if and let statements next time i work on it

// rewrote my return statement for my generatePassword function - still no luck, collaborating with the rest of the class.
